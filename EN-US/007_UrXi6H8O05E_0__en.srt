00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,879
hello youtube same from you to dot com
slash

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,960
on that game here for the New Boston in
this tutorial we'll be talking about

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,860
airs a good to hear that the project we
had opened the last 20

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,250
so in Visual Basic and

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,368
a lot mostly are other programming
languages you got three types appears

6
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,289
yes syntax errors you got your runtime
errors

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,529
and get your logic errors now I'll take
you through

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,520
these three types airs and then I'll
show you how to use the airless down

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,950
here

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,899
with airs warnings and messages so

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,859
appears we have a program and sit at a
%uh the code correctly

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,320
if we run it is going to open up and
runs perfectly fine

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,460
is gonna put out hello world this is an
example

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,230
a program that has no airs and now want
to do is a mini create there

15
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,419
this as can be said tax air so you can
see

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,620
that when I type when I remove this

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:02,820
print disease here existing air down
here in the

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,079
airless it tells us X expression
expected

19
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,569
it has the power it said so over you
know Solution Explorer

20
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,959
we've got our comments project got my
projects within

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,688
wittoled other settings and set for it
we got are filed module 1.0 BB

22
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,519
now projects you have a whole bunch
about you know a buncha bottles about

23
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,438
two classes

24
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,139
or forbes and other stuff so

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,409
this is very useful when you make bigger
programs does ill let you know

26
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,400
which file in it'd it also lets you know
which slide it is

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
and that is why we che we show the lines
by coming up here

28
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,759
to go to tools options text editor

29
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,290
general all languages and

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,960
click checked line numbers now we did
that so that

31
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,029
whenever we get airs we can see the
wider but that's it here

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,200
come over to our file and we could

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,129
come down here to identify where it is
college 26 now called 26 just means that

34
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:01,718
it is

35
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,209
16 spaces over for the left

36
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,299
right here they see that whenever you
have a syntax air

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,230
it's got a little squiggly line under it
just let you know it is

38
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,639
now if we go ahead and try to read this
it won't run in to say that

39
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,429
there were built airs ever go ahead

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,230
Texas it should run perfectly fine it
says another world right there

41
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:30,909
and now let's go ahead and talk a little
bit about runtime: airs

42
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,780
I can say example the runtime area
simple program like this

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,729
but I'll try to explain to you as best I
can now see you making

44
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,628
a I an FTP dollar which is what we're
going to make

45
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:47,818
later I'd the close the in the tutorials
what we covered everything I'm teach you

46
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,378
how to build specific programs

47
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,590
and I'm a ticket to the steps I used to
builders

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,840
so that they were creating an FTP
download we would open a file

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,789
to uploaded to the FTP server

50
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,859
so we try to open a file and it works
fine

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,459
and the ones which are uploaded to the
server its gonna give us a air because

52
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,908
say the user doesn't have access to that
now because the user doesn't have

53
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,929
write permissions when they try to
upload it is gonna give the

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,469
air the program's going to freeze up as
can stop working and

55
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,568
you had force close it so basically what
you need to do

56
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:28,318
to handle this is to you go ahead

57
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,098
and in close all that cause it was
college try catch statement

58
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,848
now what this does is it ties about good
catches in the areas that are thrown

59
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:40,298
ended want to catch those decides what
to do with them

60
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,900
now all the programs that we're going to
be riding or those muscle

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,900
over to the cause in we not gonna need
it I catch statements so will be learned

62
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,650
that later on

63
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,000
so that's pretty much what

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,889
a runtime: areas now I'll tell you what
a

65
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,658
logic area is a logic air is something

66
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:03,169
debt most the every programmer hates

67
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:07,048
what it means is that you program to
pass by erodes find

68
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,580
but then the results for the outcome
that you get from using a program is not

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,739
what you expected

70
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,849
so others too

71
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:19,298
an example a logic here this will be
really simple logic here

72
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,560
so say I forget to the Dukan so that
really bad

73
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,199
and when I read this it just flashes
encloses really quick

74
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,000
so that's just a a basic

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,168
logic here but an example

76
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:37,099
have a major allies would be let's say

77
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,030
somebody makes a calculator and they
build on these classes for it

78
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,969
and it went to go the calculated values
it the calculations are wrong

79
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,449
and that makes it really hard because it
doesn't tell you where the heirs are

80
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,610
because they're taking the day is it air
this is an area in what you did

81
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,710
and the outcome is not what you expected

82
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,258
so the doubt that covered the

83
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,590
three types of hairs we could not hear
and taken

84
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,529
closer look at a realist now you see
that we have 0 errors

85
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,589
in 0 warnings now in a warning is

86
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:13,529
is pretty much the compiler trying to
protect you from

87
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,219
areas possibly happening when you run
your code so it's a

88
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,360
me understand this let's say you create
it very well

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,840
and the variable is dole and

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,689
you try to do something but the the
variable is never signed

91
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,209
the jar call that variable you gonna get
no and you gonna get

92
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,839
and airs that so always

93
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,529
always look at your warnings don't
ignore them and I'm

94
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:41,809
other messages it's just gives the
possible things

95
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,639
that you may well okay so that you
taking a look at some of the heirs

96
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,139
an airtight you can get anybody today
released and how to

97
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,250
find those errors and fix them and go
ahead and

98
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,769
just play around a little bit more maybe
washes again just to get that stuck in

99
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,698
your head

100
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,910
and I was done with that go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial and don't
