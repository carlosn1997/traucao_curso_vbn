00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,710
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,629
on my game up for the new bassam and its
oil we're going to take another look at

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,110
math operators and some other things
they can do with it

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,428
and stuff that I went down last tutorial
so it's good decided

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:20,149
here's our mains are right here server
module which can start by creating a

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:20,750
variable

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,059
so we'll use the dim key word to say
they were gonna creative able

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,299
will give it a name which is my double
in ways that add

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,460
as keyword which tells the compiler that
were about

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,320
tell it what kinda data we want to use
and which to

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,409
double and said equal to 11

12
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,099
now a new console died

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,239
right mind my double

14
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,769
where this is going to do is is just
gonna print out the value

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,230
11 now if we come down here

16
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,078
and change the value my double with him
I double

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,420
equals my double plus

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,739
23 they will do consul

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,920
died right line my double

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,829
now we run this we're gonna get the
values

21
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:19,829
11 and 34 but if we just take this right
now right here

22
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:23,228
and copy this

23
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:26,739
okay so we take design are here

24
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,809
and add the plus 23 into the arguments

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,579
the consul that right mind where this is
going to do is is gonna bring a 11 at 34

26
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,089
but the value of my double isn't
actually changed Sophie

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,899
right out consul dot right line

28
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,728
my double again we're gonna get the
values

29
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:50,228
11 34 in 11 because we never change the
variable

30
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:56,368
it's the right there is now or gonna do

31
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,780
is I'm recover a bit sure had met so

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,409
here that's type my double

33
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,509
equals my double plus

34
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,829
23 which is what we just did now there's
easier way to do this

35
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,099
whenever you wanna at a value to very
but they have

36
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:19,149
are you have to do is do this scum this
out

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,020
with you my double plus

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,849
equals 23 so this does the empire that
we want to take the variable my double

39
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:33,789
we went at the value 23 to it enough
weed spread out again

40
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,179
we're going to get the value 11 in 34

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,769
let's go ahead and make a

42
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,409
sure they're simple program here it's
going to take a very well estimate track

43
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,000
it throughout the changes that we made

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,830
so let's take this line out right here

45
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,420
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to use Ustream

46
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:59,929
inside arguments cancelled outright
right so tight

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
initial value

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,989
11

49
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:13,989
and it will type new value and now to
combine these two together

50
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,060
which can be used the and sign so what
this does

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,310
is it takes a string that we've made in
the

52
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,900
at my double to it where this is going
to do is on the console

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,560
we're gonna see is this these letters
right here

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,699
its gonna say initial value 11 you value

55
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:37,158
11 buses we don't know what the new guy
is going to be

56
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,079
words can use the ensign print out my
double which changes

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,290
whenever we changes to the program and
we don't have to know

58
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,959
specific specifically what its equal to
you so

59
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,959
modest copy this string right here

60
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,729
and will do one more action go ahead and
do my double

61
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,049
times equals 126

62
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,170
now whenever you do this right here you
can use it with any other matter

63
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,318
operator you can divide you can subtract
you can multiply

64
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,019
you can add whenever you want so as Duke
on so that right line

65
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,079
and they will take this right here

66
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,819
were added arguments

67
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:33,089
in the open out my double with it so now
if we run this

68
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:37,319
we're gonna get initial value 11

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,689
which is the initial value my double the
new value is 11

70
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,969
because we hadn't changed it yet the
code and in

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,729
in the wind down below that to say
initial value 11 new value

72
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:53,599
34 in below that again is can say
initial by 11 you value

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,010
for that into an 84 so that is a simple
program now jacki Perry movie make

74
00:04:59,009 --> 00:04:59,839
changes to it

75
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,569
and if you have any questions feel free
to comment them

76
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,819
I'm I will be margin is BS and I thanks
for watchin

77
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,319
stay tuned for the next tutorial
