1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,200
hell YouTube same from you should %uh
how such on that game here for New

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,870
Boston

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,469
and this is your we'll be taking a look
at comments your comments are very

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,119
useful the program's

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,028
and I'm its good practice to use them a
lot would be making beer programs

6
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:19,670
so that other people that you may be
working with on your project kid

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,929
region code understand or so that you
can also reach occurred and understand

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,800
to see you go back in the forget well
what was this deal was disconnected to

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,199
I'll when the common to hear tell me
what this does

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,198
says go ahead and create a new project
we disliked a console application

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,899
could call this comment click OK

12
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,489
it will load our project

13
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:50,459
let's go ahead and create that hello a
problem that were made in the last 20

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,799
BB

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,288
he is don't get it right now I think
there we are

16
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,520
this go ahead and you console

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,900
dot right by

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,270
hello world

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,679
the console dot read

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,439
line okay so now it's at some comments
today so anybody rigby this will know

21
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,209
what's going on

22
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,819
so do this you start by adding a
quotation double course just single

23
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,279
quotes

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,060
and anything it happen that line is the
party the comment

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,650
so we'll just say this

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,280
mind rights the text

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,049
hello world to the council

28
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,130
now down here below this

29
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,839
type this lines Paz's

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,750
the program and let's the user read

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,569
the text now if we go ahead run this

32
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:00,359
you can see the Comets don't effect
occurred anyway now when you compile

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,290
your program

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,310
comments always ignored by the compiler
so is white space at this why special

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,360
here we can add as much white space as
we want and is still going to read the

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,860
same

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,950
you can also add multi-line comments

38
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,030
and he won't affect your program at all

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,419
so test

40
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,639
you need to go ahead and read this it's
going to say

41
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:32,059
hello world you can also add comments
two lines of code

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,400
that don't have common sense themselves
such as this cancelled outright mind

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,349
statement right here I can add a Comment
add to that

44
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:43,719
that says hello

45
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,628
world is a literal string

46
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,759
and it won't affect program at all and
if we go up here

47
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:57,079
read this is getting come out I'm Visual
Basic

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,370
also has a builtin to a bar option

49
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,340
appear me earlier this year quit the let
you comment

50
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,259
out lines of code so it's a we want to
convert this out

51
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:14,689
begins come up here a quick comment out
the selected lines

52
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:20,658
well with you control K and then to
chill

53
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,759
see and it will effectively coming up
his mind

54
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,469
and so now if we go ahead and run the
program you can see the program in spy

55
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,750
art does is less read aloud it doesn't
actually print out hello world

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,989
and out on top with them

57
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,080
you just highlight what you want on
comment come up here

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
and click this you know and company

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,519
comment it for you I can also do right
here and if we run this

60
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,090
you see that classes open your fast then
closes
