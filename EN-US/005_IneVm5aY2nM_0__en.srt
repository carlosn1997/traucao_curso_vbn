00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,520
hello youtube same here from you to duck
house

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,450
on that Gaber this tutorial we'll be
taking a look at primitive data types

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,629
now what these are is pretty much the
building blocks have all the programs

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,269
you gonna bake

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,260
now I brokenness down in several
different categories sorry the top

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,539
we have primitive data types this is
divided into three more subsections

7
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,439
we've got numbers characters and logical

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,868
now under the numbers category we have

9
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,140
integers now this is all members that
aunt decibel

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,210
don't have decibels we have bite

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,649
which is a very small digit number that
can hold a value

12
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,500
starting at -120 a all the way up to
posit 127

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,909
now if you go past that well has
happened is called overflow and you will

14
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,169
get an airing the program

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,030
we've got the sort data type right here
which

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,149
is a sixteen-bit type it has a value

17
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,198
decade spent from negative 32768

18
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:03,698
all the way up to $32767

19
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:07,129
now we have the int type

20
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:10,069
for the integers now this is the type
that we're going to be easy most the

21
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:10,399
time

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,990
most the time in our tutorials because
we don't need to use by

23
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:19,459
short the we must because we don't have
to conserve resources we're not making

24
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,669
programs that are so big that we need to
use these

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,259
to conserve the pro to to serve the
resources and

26
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,439
int is just big enough rest use

27
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,339
and dad we will NEVER go outside the
Rams at that and

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,150
int data type is 32-bit and it can have
a beautiful

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,390
value native two billion $147 billion
480 3,680 for

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,259
and maximum value is $2 billion 147,000

31
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,519
483 I'm two billion $1.47 billion

32
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,739
for nearly three thousand 647 and over
here we have

33
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,250
long now at long is is its very much

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,828
7 sponsor is a lot integer it's a 64-bit

35
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:08,228
type and he can have a maximum value

36
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,879
the on Etsy 9

37
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,848
this the 9

38
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:22,609
workers at two trillion hold on here
that the maximum value and that long

39
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,709
is 9 quintillion 223 quadrillion

40
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,819
372 trillion $36 billion

41
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,089
$854 million 775,000

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,719
807 and the minimum value that

43
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,449
is pretty much that negative but said
any with 808

44
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,389
the here 807 into 808 now there are
other data types

45
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,919
in is a basic that I'm not gonna cover
in this

46
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,409
such as BigInteger which is something
that has been added the dotnet framework

47
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,449
4.0

48
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:58,459
and from what I've read about it and it
does not have a limit

49
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,819
so I'll Giuffrida player out that if you
could buy some places online

50
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,139
I will show you how to use that and now
moving on we have

51
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,309
real numbers now are real numbers are is
out anything that could hold a decimal

52
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,830
value

53
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,640
now we have double and float now double

54
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,299
is a 64-bit that type Anakin holds

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:26,300
with see term it's a 734 firm in point
which may not be missed you but

56
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,200
with that basically means is that you
can hold he really long decibel

57
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,708
and a float is a very the double

58
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,219
it's a quite similar and now moving on
to characters

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,289
we have what's called a character which
will hold

60
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,628
one characters such as the letter A or
the letter T or G

61
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:50,370
it is also one of those and now one
thing I did the list that

62
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,408
isn't technically a primitive data types
but I am I thought that

63
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:57,519
I strategic assessment in this tutorial
is a string

64
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,150
as pretty much a bunch of characters put
together he saw this in hello world

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,688
tutorial its enclosed into quotes

66
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:11,430
and it can hold as many characters as
you want and spaces and other stuff and

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,959
now

68
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,719
last but not least we have a logical
ideological we have to lean

69
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,759
bullying is a doubt type that can hold a
valuable

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,680
true or boss now you find this very
useful when you start making programs

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,250
so take a look at this chart make sure
you tomorrow this will be working with

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,279
these data types coming up in the next
two wheels

73
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,599
