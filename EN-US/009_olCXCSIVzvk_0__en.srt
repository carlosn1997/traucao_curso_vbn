00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,080
hello youtube

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,349
same from you to die com slash OnLive
game here

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:09,638
for the New Boston in this tutorial
we'll be taking a look

4
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,539
at simple math operators so that's good
decided

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,299
we're gonna come up here into our code
I'm going to start off by declaring a

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,960
variable

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,070
now we're gonna make it integer so do II

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,210
as integer will go ahead and said that
he qualified

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,750
or here was not that said that he could
anything yet

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,219
so did not mind equals side

11
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,420
plus by snafu come down here

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,789
and print out number one on the console

13
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:49,789
it's going to give us the output 10
where we can also do

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,558
is used the parameters a bright line

15
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,649
cue add numbers 2.1 so we're be by this

16
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:00,820
is that say we have no blood we want to
print out dumb one

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,868
plus 5 so we read this

18
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:09,719
we should get 15 now if we come here

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,519
we can also subtract five so nobody
conspired -5

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,728
that's going to give us the value of 0
and now

21
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,868
we print that out it's going to take
this out we put that up

22
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,769
here we get 0 we can also do

23
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:30,209
division so to divide is a basic

24
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,679
this is the same throughout mostly all
languages you use the forward slash

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,170
so if we divide time by 5 we're going to
get the value

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,469
wide and to multiply

27
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,048
use use the asterisk so fight outside

28
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,649
is equal to 25 right there

29
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:52,310
and now we can also do

30
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,780
the powers so 5 to power

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,700
to is going to equal 25

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,930
every five to the power 3

33
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,950
we're gonna get what is 125 so here we
go 125 right there

34
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,458
now what we can also do

35
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,878
is what's called module is now this is a
little

36
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,530
to keep for some people to understand
about how to explain it the best I can

37
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,750
well by julos does is it will divide two
integers for you

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,239
and they give you the remainder so if we
do five

39
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,409
mod to so so what happens when you bite
by bite you

40
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,189
you can get to with the remainder have
one as his reason it is we can't get

41
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,969
decibel so we're going to get a
remainder

42
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,699
so now if we run this you can see that
it prints out

43
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,209
one we can also

44
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,530
at variables to each other so

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,409
if we declared them one as integer and
we said equal to 4

46
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,900
we can declare second variable scholars
on

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,610
to okay did Jer and we'll set it equal
to

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,180
8 it now if we print out

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,349
number one place no

50
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,530
to is gonna give us the value have

51
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,209
12 this also works

52
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,330
for all the other operators that we've
seen we can multiply them together

53
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:28,330
which will give us the value 32 and what
we can do

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,430
is written create a third able here
let's just do that

55
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,510
creative able to answer on

56
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,818
make it integer you know said equal to

57
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,359
or personal said equal to

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,140
nothing basically what nothing is is if
you've learned

59
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,689
any other languages its equivalent to
dole so

60
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,658
answer instead a not assigning answer
value

61
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,669
was himself equal than nothing you can
see that

62
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,969
it won't give us a a warning here so

63
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,158
if we take this out we get a warning

64
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,650
but since we assign it to nothing

65
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,930
which is equivalent to no we don't get
one here and that will

66
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,699
prevent airs from possibly happen in the
future so that down here

67
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,370
was typed answer equals

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,490
no mind divided by them

69
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,280
to now in our case in this program we
didn't have to

70
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,719
set is equal to nothing that's when
mister that in there so you guys and

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,460
know what it is

72
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,209
be able to use a weight on your programs
so answer equals

73
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,430
number one divided by dumped you so

74
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,579
if we right out answer

75
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,228
we are going to get 0

76
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:51,859
so if you for divided by

77
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,290
8 you get a decimal number

78
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,379
and since integers can't can't

79
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,418
im they can implicitly convert
themselves to

80
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:06,459
decibels is just gonna give you zero so

81
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,719
let's go ahead and change this to you
multiply

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,870
and we're going to get 32

83
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,228
now since before we got zero by dividing
them

84
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,579
by two other I'm William a show you how
to fix this

85
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,668
what we're gonna do instead of making
the integers

86
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:29,008
we're gonna make them doubles here

87
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,210
we don't have to make those doubles we
can make the answer

88
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,430
a double so

89
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,449
now since I answer can have decimal
numbers if we divide number my name to

90
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,889
we will get 0.5

91
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,129
so take a look at some these math
operators and play around them with

92
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,079
doubles integers you can use a by you
can use along can is

93
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,609
anything just play around with his math
operators get used to them

94
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,979
in what you got that down go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial

95
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,120
