00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,160
hello youtube Sam from you to dot com
slash

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,589
on I came here for the New Boston in
this tutorial

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,150
will be talked about variables now
variables are the most important parts a

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,839
programming

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,919
there's no possible way to make a
program without variables

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,649
so understood started and will create a
variable here

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,198
now to create a variable in Visual Basic
you can start off with the keyword

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,070
diem now what this tells the compiler is
that you're going to declare

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,300
a variable so you read this

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,259
right here from intelligent says that
the dim statement declares and allocates

11
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:42,849
here declares allocates new storage
space for one or more variables

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,350
so or gonna do israeli type did

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,320
it after this you can type whatever name
you want as long as it contains bad

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,100
characters

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,179
now as those that you could buy it was
about characters

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,289
online or invalid characters some was
just %ah

17
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,600
by calling it by them he condemned this
whatever you feel like

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,189
and now after we tell the compiler

19
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:09,929
I'll what the neighbors are variables
gonna be we're gonna type

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,880
has services says specifies the data
type in the Dec

21
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,129
declaration statements that was gonna
tell the compiler what kinda data type

22
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:17,839
is gonna be

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,840
as a way to make ours and integer and so
you can see that little green line comes

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:25,859
into that

25
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,269
and is a warning here says a news local
variable not

26
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,319
by now so would have a kid programs

27
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,978
if you never use a variable the careless
is going to tell you the warning so that

28
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:37,798
you can take that out

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,570
the program more efficient or using my
dance or just ignore that

30
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,648
warning for right now so now we're going
to do is win a signed by

31
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,540
sort i mind equals by

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,549
now if we do cancel

33
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,810
dot right line

34
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,649
my nom and they'll do console dot

35
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,909
read line we go ahead run this

36
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,950
its gonna say 5 right there

37
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,619
now what we can do is wicked

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,569
instead of putting this into lines we
can go ahead and set the value

39
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:19,689
are variable in the declaration I'm

40
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:23,669
so it is a sequel to 5 there now the
reason I showed you

41
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,098
the 2i bet they'd before that is because
sometimes you to be declaring a variable

42
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:32,219
wanna be ourselves and later on he said
she gonna be a sign that another value

43
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,098
now that would be

44
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:36,409
a way you wouldn't do that so for
example

45
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,750
if I read this good read this you know
say

46
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,500
5 now come down here

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,900
set minor equal to something else such
as seven

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,430
to go and read this is going to print
out seven

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,840
because even though we decide lies my
debit 5

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,709
after we do that its gonna re

51
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,920
its gonna change the value my dad 27 and
its gonna write the

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,189
most recent value by them now doesn't
save the old values it just updated

53
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,289
so it's gonna start at five which ended

54
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,289
7 and it prints out the seven which is
the what it's completely equal to

55
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,669
so let's go ahead and

56
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,908
work with a another time QB Taylor

57
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:25,669
I want to not caps lock tap okay

58
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,289
says go ahead and get rid of my
government here and will the Clearstream

59
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,378
sodium my string as

60
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:38,750
string and we're going to set it equal
to hello

61
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,900
do Boston

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,700
sands so now if we come back here

63
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,399
and we've cancelled outright mine we're
just gonna put my string

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,709
as the arguments and you can see that it
prints out

65
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,310
hello the New Boston fans now if you
wanna do a character

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,759
we can just do Tim my

67
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,568
character as Carey Rs

68
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:13,579
char elsa equal to a for him a

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,359
every type out my

70
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,728
character you can see that in Oprah now

71
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,189
a for us now let's go ahead and do

72
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:29,319
a double really quick simply to double

73
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,269
the Eagle said Eagle 25.4 go-ahead run
this

74
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:39,728
your say 5.4 for us now this work with
able in real quick

75
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:43,019
would create a bullied variable said

76
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,629
equal to you either true or false so so
you go to

77
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,000
and will pronounce my character

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,500
or hear those changes to my

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,980
pool

80
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,220
now you can see here that it prints out
true now can also set this to

81
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,730
false if we

82
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:15,100
run this is going to bring up false now
here's something that I was going to

83
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,740
teach you guys in a related to real

84
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,490
but I figured that you guys a smart so

85
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,660
I'll go and teach it to you in this
tutorial now whenever you

86
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,370
create in a variable and let's just do

87
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,649
escape integer now said he qualified

88
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:36,669
what we want to do is in our Casa not
right line

89
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,460
what we want to take mine and we want to
convert it

90
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,419
to a string now you may not notice any
difference

91
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,710
any differences in this but I'll I was
taught

92
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:52,289
that whenever you its good coding
practice to convert

93
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,490
numbers two strings when you gonna be
printing about anywhere on the screen

94
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,730
such as the label

95
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,170
or text box or console which is what
we're we are working in

96
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,759
so to convert a string you just do the
variable that you want

97
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,240
dot to string with empty parameters

98
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,269
in this is going to convert your integer
to string now clear on this

99
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:15,699
you can see it puts out by but instead
of putting out a number this is actually

100
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,339
a string

101
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,459
so

102
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,719
that's about all I will recover in the
variables tutorial

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,430
so I'm passes and variables I'm

104
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,959
make some your own printing out and get
used to what they are

105
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,409
and then once you've got that now down
move on to the next tutorial and don't
