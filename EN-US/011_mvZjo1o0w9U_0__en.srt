00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,459
hell YouTube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,960
on live gamer for the New Boston and the
situation will be talking about getting

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
user input from the Consul

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,000
now this is very useful when you can
console applications

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,240
because what's the point in making an
application

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,939
if the user can it imply anything so
it's going to get started

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,879
go ahead aid creator Bob variables here

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,379
so use diem wishes to you

9
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:34,119
user name as string I'll start off by
setting

10
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,968
setting equal to nothing now this is
just

11
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:41,000
a safety precautions here because if the
user

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,179
does not input anything as they re

13
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,340
name did stream would not be equal to a
value

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,579
and we're getting a reef which I print
that out on the console

15
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,140
says go ahead and clear another

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,549
value so user age as integer

17
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,738
in said that people are nothing just in
case they don't imply anything

18
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:06,590
because they will get an area of which I
print out something that's not equal to

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,118
anything

20
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,799
so they will do diem

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,689
users salary has

22
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,699
double I'll go ahead and take that

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,689
said that equal to nothing as well so
now what we're going to do you

24
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,750
is real prompt the user to input some
information

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,430
soul just create a string it out over
arguments

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,360
and will type what is your name

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,310
now we want to do

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,320
is ruining it wait for them to you

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,408
I'm putting their name so what we gonna
do

30
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,719
to do this is going to type username

31
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,170
equals consul

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,290
dot read lines so what this does

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,469
is whenever the user types in

34
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:04,649
a string of characters and presses enter
its gonna read that by Darren story in

35
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,140
the variable username

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,270
the wicked go I'm

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,180
and prompted to type something else so
the console dot

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,480
right line what

39
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,799
is your age and it will type

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,209
user age equals

41
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:33,209
time so dot read by

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,319
and we'll just do that again and get
their salary civil type

43
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,128
console dot right line

44
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,199
what is yours salary

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,798
and we use disappear again

46
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,400
to get their salary from the council so
tight user

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,280
salary equals console died

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,289
read line

49
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:05,139
snap a good run this

50
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,929
you see is going to say what is your
name it's about have been Sam

51
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,450
press Enter what it does is its stores
same

52
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,318
in stride inside username him free

53
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,328
typing aids sauce a 15

54
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,450
out at my salary so it's a

55
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,780
I know I am a millionaire's so five
hundred dollars

56
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,459
our for 550 insisted that and I

57
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,569
see it didn't do anything so we
basically did

58
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:38,449
was we prompted the user to type in
something

59
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:41,878
it we got that from the console and
historian username

60
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,098
but we need to do something with using
so we're gonna do

61
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:48,268
is we're going to print that out

62
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,289
so to cancel dot right line

63
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,209
you make

64
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,329
or hola

65
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:05,939
your name is and they will just add
their name

66
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:12,180
so user name as go ahead and take
outlined here

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,530
and they will do

68
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:23,529
console dot right shit at a space your
core spaces

69
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:29,490
you were age is it will just

70
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,490
add user age in console that right again

71
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:46,519
your salary is

72
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,519
okay so what this test is it's going to
you

73
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,219
right out your name is but he says
instead of using right mind we use right

74
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,310
so what this does is once it's done
writing this text right here is not

75
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,829
gonna go down to the next line

76
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,389
and its gonna pre your age is on the
same minus that is can also bring your

77
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,240
salary is

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,069
on the same ones that so then this go
ahead

79
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,920
and just you consul dot right mind

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,980
to go ahead in the wind so that we can
read

81
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,420
what's on the Consul his go-ahead run
this

82
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,090
say what is your name I type in same

83
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,369
say what is your age I did fifteen was
your salary

84
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,649
five hundred dollars and fifty cents an
hour you know say

85
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,370
your name is Sam you were ages 15 the
salary is 505

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,420
now whenever you type in a

87
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,530
a number value into the Consul so sad
type in five hundred-point 50

88
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,799
0 is not needed so it is taken out when
I print that

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,050
so say I typed 00 500

90
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,810
it's gonna take that I just gimme five
hundred now I'll give you an example

91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,240
this

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,699
socket type you say what is your name

93
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,769
types ambush a I type 000 15

94
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,509
what is your salary as 000

95
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,659
miss you eight dollars time eight
dollars 34 cents an hour

96
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,130
say your name is Sam you were ages 15
and your salary is 834

97
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:21,319
so what this does is it takes out all
the unnecessary

98
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,439
zeros in there because 0000 or however
many zeros are

99
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,439
15 is just equal to the value 15

100
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,449
so Visual Basic is going to take out the
zeros for E

101
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,500
you could if you wanted to you could
change that to a string

102
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,889
and it would print out all these numbers
together and not take out those zeros

103
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,029
if you want to so I'm extorted

104
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,869
and stay tuned for the next tutorial
